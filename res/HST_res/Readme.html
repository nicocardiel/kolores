Last updated 30/05/97 by S. Baggett, S. Casertano, and M. Wiggs<p>

This directory contains ASCII versions of the WFPC2 filter 
throughput tables.  <p>

We provide tables for each filter in isolation as well as for each
filter including the system response and CCD QE.<p>

All tables were created using the synphot package of STSDAS (23 April
1997 version). The tables each contain two columns, wavelength and
throughput. Note that with the May 1997 update, the chip dqe's are no
longer identical and so, system throughputs are chip-dependent.<p>

The tables have the following naming convention:<p>
<pre>
filtername.txt           Throughput tables for each 
                         filter in isolation
ccd_filtername_sys.txt   Throughput tables for each filter 
                         including the system response 
		         and CCD QE.
